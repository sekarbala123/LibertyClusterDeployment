# IBM WebSphere Liberty Cluster POC - Requirements

## Project Type
**PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC)** - Not production-ready, for demonstration and learning purposes only.

## Core Requirements

### Technology Stack
- Java EE 8 (strictly, not Jakarta EE)
- JRE 17
- IBM WebSphere Liberty Server in cluster mode (collective)
- Maven for build management

### Application Structure
- WAR application deployed as an EAR (Enterprise Archive)
- Multi-module Maven project structure

### Functionality
- Simple RESTful service to query cluster members
- REST endpoints that return properties of collective members
- Admin Center enabled for cluster management

### REST API Endpoints
- `/api/cluster` - Returns basic cluster/server information
- `/api/members` - Returns JSON array of all collective members
- `/api/member-details` - Returns detailed member information
- `/api/members/detailed` - Returns comprehensive member data
- `/api/members/mbeans` - Lists all WebSphere MBeans
- `/api/members/repo-operations` - Shows repository operations

### Security (POC Level)
- Basic authentication with encoded passwords (XOR encoding)
- Admin Center access with credentials
- Not production-grade security (suitable for POC/demo only)
- Default credentials: admin / admin123!

### Documentation
- Detailed setup and configuration guides
- REST API examples with curl commands
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Architecture diagrams

### Build & Deployment
- IBM WebSphere Liberty server can be downloaded automatically via Maven
- All configuration files included in project
- Scripts for starting/stopping cluster

## POC Scope Limitations

### What This POC Includes ✅
- Working Liberty collective (controller + 2 members)
- REST API to query cluster members
- Basic security configuration
- Admin Center access
- Complete documentation
- Maven build automation

### What This POC Does NOT Include ❌
- Production-grade security (LDAP, OAuth, etc.)
- High availability configuration
- Load balancing setup
- Monitoring and alerting
- Automated testing
- CI/CD pipeline
- Database integration
- Performance tuning
- Disaster recovery
- Enterprise user management

## Development Guidelines
- Use git for version control
- Create checkpoints before major changes
- Maintain this requirements file
- Update TODO.md with task progress
- Keep documentation current

## Success Criteria for POC
1. ✅ Liberty collective successfully configured
2. ✅ REST endpoints return cluster member information
3. ✅ Admin Center accessible and functional
4. ✅ Application builds and deploys successfully
5. ✅ Documentation complete and accurate
6. ✅ Security enhanced beyond quickStartSecurity

## Notes
- This is a demonstration/learning project
- Security is suitable for POC/development only
- For production use, significant hardening required
- See SECURITY-CONFIGURATION.md for production recommendations
